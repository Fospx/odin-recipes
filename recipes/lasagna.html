    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        The chipotle chicken recipe doesn't take much effort to make. It is 
        well mixed and used with chicken for tacos, burriots, bowls, or fajitas.
        The chicken is sweet and chewy to the taste and a great choice for a healthy
        diet. There are not that many ingredients so this is very friendly for beginners.
