            <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 pound ground chuck beef (80% lean)</li>
            <li>4 6-inch squares parchment paper</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>4 slices American cheese</li>
            <li>burger toppings of choice</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="heading steps">Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.
                 Set a cast iron flat-top griddle or large cast iron skillet onto
                 the grill and preheat until smoking.
            </li>
            <li>Spread butter on the inside of the bunns and toast on the 
                flat-top until lightly browned. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>Form meat into 8 loosely-packed balls, 2 ounces each. Do not pack
                the meat tightly, as this will prevent it from smashing properly.
                 Place each ball on the hot flat-top, cover with a piece of parchemnt
                 (to prevent sticking to spatula) and immediately smash down to 
                 a 1/4 inch thickness using 2 stiff, sturdy spatulas that are 
                 criss-crossed to get proper leverage as you press down. You may also use the bottom
                 of small skillet. Sprinkle the meat with salt.
            </li>
            <li>Grill for about 45 seconds, until the edges are dark brown and the centers are
                a light pink color. Using a bench scraper or girm spatula, gently scrape up the patties, 
                flip over and immediately cover 4 of them with cheese. Grill an additional 15 
                to 20 seconds; stack the plain patties over the cheese-covered patties so you 
                have 4 stacks. Move each stack to a bun and serve with your favorite toppings.
            </li>
        </ol>
